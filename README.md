# Op Amp Discovery Board
## Fast & Veratile Prototyping and Experimenter Board
The Op Amp Discovery Board allows students, engineers and DIYers to quickly prototype and experiment with a variety of op amp configurations. Get circuits up and running fast!

- Easy-to-use hybrid (solderless breadboard + PCB).
- Explore 20+ classic op amp circuits
- Create your own circuits
- Supply Rails & Signal Source Included on-board

Hands-on trainer boosts understanding and intuition!
- Flexible - easily install Rs, Cs or jumpers across any headers.
- Fun problem solving - How-to-build circuit on available component headers?
- Configurable signal - DC, AC, square-wave, level trimpot
- Powered by 9V Battery

Standard breadboards can be frustrating:
- Prone to opens, shorts, intermittent connections
- Confusing, difficult to probe and debug
- Requires expensive, bulky supplies and signal generators
